# creditcard_fraud

Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The model is trained using the Random Forest algorithm, which is known for its high accuracy and robustness in classification tasks. Additionally, the system integrates Plaid to verify real transactions, ensuring that the fraud detection model works effectively in a real-world scenario.
